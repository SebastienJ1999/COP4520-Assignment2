# COP4520-Assignment2

Regarding question one, there are two ways it can be answered. 1. Is to answer the question directly using logic which in my opinion, the guest could either leave a cupcake on the table until there are enough cupcakes that match the amount of people so the final person counts and sees if it matches the amount of people in total. The other way is to have everyone who went into the maze and got their cupcake to keep their hands raised when they get out since it's not verbally communicating, it would count. Now the 2nd way to answer the question is coding wise. I made it randomly choose a number between 1 to n and gave it a small chance to call that same number again until everyone has been called.
Regarding question two, I used the queue because the first one as was stated would have guest crowding the door which would slow down process times. So option 2 and 3 seem the best in my opinion. This makes sure that the guest enter and exit properly and that everyone ends up getting a chance to enter and see the room.
